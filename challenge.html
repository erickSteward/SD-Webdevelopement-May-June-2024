            In a world of tags and stylesheets bright,
            <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> dance in the light.
            HTML, the skeleton, structure defined,
            With elements nested, beautifully aligned.
        </pre>

        <pre>
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> to start the show,
        </pre>

        <pre>
            Head, body, divs, oh the places they'll go!
            Paragraphs, headings, lists galore,
            Anchors and images, begging to explore.
        </pre>

        <pre>
            But wait! Here comes CSS, with flair,
            <i>To paint the canvas, to style with care.</i>
            Selectors and properties, a symphony they weave,
            Color, font, layout, to make the page breathe.
        </pre>

        <pre>
            From margins to paddings, floats and grids,
            Flexbox and grids, where design bids.
            Media queries, responsive and bold,
            To adapt and fit, as screens unfold.
        </pre>

        <pre>
            So hand in hand, HTML and CSS <s>stride</s>,
            Creating wonders, where creativity can't hide.
            Basics they may be, but oh, what power they hold,
            In the world wide web, where stories are told.
