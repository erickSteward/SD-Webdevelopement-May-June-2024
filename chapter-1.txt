Chapter 1 - Websites

Introduction to Websites and the world Wide Websites

The world wide web is often abriviated WWW or simply the web, is a vast collection of interconnected documents and resources accessible via the internet.
It is a global information system that allows users to access share and exchange information from anywhere in 
the world.

The web was initialy concieved in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at CERN(the european oragnization for Neuclear research) as a way to share and link information among fellow researchers.

Berners-Lee developed the foundational technologies that make the web possible including hypertext trasfer protocol (HTTP), Uniform Resource Identifors(URIs), and Hypertext Markup Language(HTML).

Today, the World Wide Web has evolved into a ubiquitous platform that permeates virtually every  aspect of our lives. It serves as a vast repository of information , a platform for comunication and collaboration, a marketplace for goods and services, and a medium for entertainment and social interation,

How the web works: Key Terms and Defination

To understand how the world wide web functions, its essentail to comprehend the following key terms and concepts

1. Client-server Architecture
The web followings a client-server Architecture, where clients (typically web browers) initiate requests and srvers respond to those requests. The architecture allows for efficent communication and resource sharing between devices on the internet.

2. Hypertext Transfer Protocal(HTTP):
HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the web.
It is a Protocal that defines the rules and standards for trasmiting data between web browers(clients) and wev servers
HTTP gorverns how requests are made, how servers respond, and how is trasfered

3. Uniform Resource Locator(URL):
A URL is the address used to locate and access a specific resource on the web.
It specfies the protocol (eg. HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name or IP address of the web servers, and the path to the requested resource.

4. Domain Name System (DNS)
The DNS is a hierachical and decentralized naming system that translated human readable domain name(example.com) into numerical IP address that computers understand.
This system allows users to access websites using memorable domain names instead of IP addresses.

5. Web server
A web server is a computer prorgram or software that handles request from clients and delivers web content(HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Images, etc...) in response. 
Popular webserver software include Apache, and Nginx

6. Web browers
A web Brower is a sofware application that runs on a client device, (eg. desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, or tablets) and its used to display web content.
They are used to interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web pages and provide a user interfsce for intercting with the web.

7. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML):
HTML is the standard Markup languange used to structure and define the content of the web pages.
It provides a way it organize and present information using various elements. such as Heading, paragraphs, lists, link and multimedia.

8. Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
CSS is a style sheet language used to control the visual presentation of HTML elements on the web pages.
It allows developers to define style for elements, including layout, colors, font, and other design.

9. JavaScript
Is a programing language used to add interactivity to a dynamic behavior to the web pages.
It enables features such as dropdown menus, form validation, animations, real-time updates, interative visualizations.

Here is an example of how this components work together when a user requests a webpage.

-> The user enters a URL(https://www.example.com/about) into the browers.

-> The browser initiates an HTTP request to the server specified in the URLs.

-> The DNS system traslats the domain name into an IP address that the browsers can use to locate the webserver.

-> The webserver that recieves the HTTP request and processed it.

-> If the request resource (eg. /about) exists, the webserver retrieves the corresponding feild(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, etc) and send them back to the browser in an HTTP response.

-> The browser recieve the HTTP response and renders the webpages by interprating the HTML 



A website is a collection of interconnected web pages  images, videos and other digital assets hosted on a web server and accesible through a uniqure URL (UNIFOTM Resource Locator).
Websites are built using three core technologies
1. HTML
HTML is the standard Markup languange used to structure and define the content of the web pages.
It provides a way it organize and present information using various elements. such as Heading, paragraphs, lists, link and multimedia.

2. CSS
Is a style sheet language used to control visual presentation of HTNL elements on a web page.
It allows developers to define styles for element including layout, colors, font, and other design.
CSS separated the presentation from the content, enabling consistent, and maintainable styling across multiple webpages.

3. JavaScript
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that adds interractivty and dynamic behavior to webpages.
It enables features such as dropdown menus, form validatrion, animatrion real-time update, interactive visualization.
JavaScript also can be used to communicate with web servers, retrieve and manipulate data, and enhance the overall user experience.

While HTML provide the overall structure and content, CSS handles the visual styling , JavaScript adds functionality and interativity to websites, creating a rich and engage user experience.

Web Servers and Web browsers
To access websites users need a web browser which is a sofware application designed to rerivie, present and navigate information in the world Wide web.

Web browers acts a clients, sending request to web servers and rendering the recieve content for users to view and interact with.
Popular web browers include google chrome, mozzilla FireFox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Opera.

Each browers has its rendering engine and may interprate and display web content slightly differently which is why wed dev often test their websited accross mulitiple browers to ensure consistent behavior.

Web Server on the other hand are computer systems that store webpage  and other web content to client over the internet.
When a user request a web page by entering a URL in ther browers, the browser sends a request to the correspondinf web server , which retrieves the requested files and trasmit them back to the browers. for rendering and display.

URL structure and domain namesA URL is the address used to locate and access a specific resource on the www
URL typically consist of several components:

https://www.example.com/path/to/resource?query=string#fragment

-> Scheme The prortocal used to access the resource, such as http:// or https://

-> Host The domain name or IP address of the web server hosting the website (eg. example.com)

-> Path: the folder structure and the file name of the requested resource on the server (eg. /path/to/resource)

Query => optional paramenters or data passed to the server for processing (eg ?query=string)

Fragment => is an internal reference withing the reasource used for linking to specific section or elements (eg #fragment)

web hostin and publishing websites

To make a website available on the internet, it needs to be hosted on a web server.
Web hosting services provide the nessecary infrusture and resource to store and server website files to users worldwide.

There are various types of webhosting options available each with its own adantages and limitations

1. Sharing Hostiing: In Shared hosting, multiple websites are hosted on a single server, sharing its resources(CPU, RAM, disk space, etc). This is cost-effective option for small to medium-sized websites with modarate traffic.

2. Virtual Privast Server (VPS) is a virtualized envirionment that provides dedicated resources within a shared server.
This option offers more control and flrxibility than the shared hosting and is sutable for websited with higher traffic and resource requirements

3. Dedicated SErver Hosting: The entire physical sever is dedicated to s single client, providing maximum control and performance and security.
This option is typically more expensive snf suitable for high-traffic websites or approaches with strict security or complices requirements.

4. Cloud Hosting: Cloud Hosting Utiklized a network of vitual machines and resource that can dynamically scale up or down. based onthe website demands

This option offers flexibility, scalability and high availablilty making it suitable for websited with flactuating or unpredicatabe traffic pattarms.

Web standard and best practices
As a web continues to evolve, it is essential to follow web standards and best practicess to ensure that the website are accesible, usable and maintainable.
Some key princible and guildlines incluced]
1. Accessibility: Designing websites that are accessible to users with disablity, following guildings like the wev content accessiblity guildlines(WCAG)

2. Responsive Design: Creating websites that adopt and provide an optional viewing experience across different divices and screen size.

3. Search Engine Optimization: Optimazing websites for better visibility and ranking in searching engines results.

4. performance Optimization: Implementing techniques to improve website load times, such as minifyinf code, compressing assestsm and leveranging caching mechanism.

5. security: Implementing security measures to protect websites and user data from potential threat, such as Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks

6. Usability and user experience: Design Websites with a focus on intuitive naviagtion, clear information architechture, and a seamless user experience.

7. Code Best Practices: Following coding Convention writing clean code and maintainabler code
