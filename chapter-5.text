CHAPTER 5: HYPERLINKS

Introduction to hyperlinks

Definition and purpose of hyperlinks:
-> Hyperlinks, commonly known as links, are the fundamental building blocks of the World
Wide Web.
-> They allow users to navigate from one web page or resource to another by clicking on or
activating a linked text, image, or other element.
• Hyperlinks enable the interconnectivity and seamless navigation between different web
pages and websites.
Different types of hyperlinks:
• Internal links: Links that navigate within the same website or web page (e.g., anchor links).
• External links: Links that navigate to a different website or web page.
• File links: Links that allow users to download or access specific files (e.g., PDF, Word
documents, images).
• Email links: Links that open the user's email client with a pre-populated email address or
subject line.
Creating hyperlinks
<a> element for creating links:
• The <a> element, short for "anchor," is used to create hyperlinks in HTML.
• The href attribute within the <a> element specifies the destination URL or resource to link to.
• Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
href attribute for specifying the link destination:
• The href attribute provides the URL or path to the linked resource.
• URLs can be absolute (e.g., https://www.example.com) or relative (e.g., ./about.html).
• The href attribute can also point to other protocols, such as mailto: for email links or tel: for
phone links.
Link text and formatting:
• The text between the opening and closing <a> tags represents the clickable or tappable
portion of the link.
• Links can be styled using CSS properties like color, text-decoration, and font-weight.
• Example: <a href="https://www.example.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration:
underline;">Visit Example Website</a>
Linking to external resources
Linking to other websites:
• To link to another website, provide the complete URL in the href attribute.
• Example: <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
Linking to files (documents, images, etc.):
• The href attribute can be used to link to various file types, such as PDFs, Word documents, or
images.
• Example: <a href="documents/report.pdf">Download Report</a>
Internal linking
Linking within the same website:
• Internal links are used to navigate between different pages or sections within the same
website.
• Provide the relative path to the target page or file in the href attribute.
• Example: <a href="about.html">About Us</a>
Using relative and absolute paths:
• Relative paths are used to link to resources within the same website, starting from the
current file's location.
• Absolute paths provide the full URL, including the domain, to link to resources within the
same website.
Anchor links for navigating within a page:
• Anchor links, also known as fragment identifiers or hash links, allow navigation to specific
sections within the same web page.
• They use the id attribute on the target element and the corresponding #id in the href
attribute of the link.
• Example: <a href="#section2">Jump to Section 2</a> and <h2 id="section2">Section 2</h2>
Link attributes
target attribute for specifying link behavior:
• The target attribute determines how the linked resource will be displayed when the link is
clicked or activated.
• Common values include _self (opens in the same window/tab), _blank (opens in a new
window/tab), and _parent (opens in the parent frame).
title attribute for providing additional information about the link:
• The title attribute allows you to provide additional information or a tooltip about the linked
resource.
• This information is displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link.
• Example: <a href="https://www.example.com" title="Visit our website">Example
Website</a>
Student challenge:
• Create a webpage with various types of hyperlinks, including internal and external links, file
links, and anchor links.
• Experiment with different link styles using CSS.
• Implement a navigation menu with internal links to different sections within the same page.
• Include a link to download a file (e.g., a PDF document or an image).
• Use the target attribute to specify how certain links should open (e.g., in a new tab or
window).
Practical example:
• Build a simple website with multiple pages and implement proper internal and external
linking.
• Create a header or navigation menu with internal links to different sections or pages within
the website.
• Include external links to relevant resources or other websites.
• Add anchor links within a long page to allow users to quickly navigate to specific sections.
• Provide file links for users to download resources like PDFs or images.
• Style the links using CSS to enhance their visual appearance and make them more userfriendly.
Summary:
• Hyperlinks are the foundation of the World Wide Web, enabling navigation between web
pages and resources.
• The <a> element and its href attribute are used to create hyperlinks in HTML.
• Links can be internal (within the same website), external (to other websites), or reference
files or email addresses.
• Relative and absolute paths are used for internal linking, while anchor links allow navigation
within the same page.
• Link attributes like target and title provide control over link behavior and additional
information.
• Proper implementation of hyperlinks, combined with CSS styling, enhances the user
experience and navigation of websites.
