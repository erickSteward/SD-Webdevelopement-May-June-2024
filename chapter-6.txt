CHAPTER 6: IMAGES
Introduction to images on the web
Importance of images in web design:
• Images play a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of websites.
• They can convey information, create emotional connections, and make content more
engaging and memorable.
• Properly used images can improve the overall aesthetics, clarity, and usability of web pages.
Image file formats:
• JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): Best suited for photographs and complex images
with many colors.
• PNG (Portable Network Graphics): Ideal for graphics with transparent backgrounds, logos,
and simple images with fewer colors.
• GIF (Graphics Interchange Format): Commonly used for simple animations and images with
limited color palettes.
• SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): An XML-based vector image format that scales well and
supports animations and interactivity.
Inserting images
<img> element for adding images:
• The <img> element is used to insert images into web pages.
• It is a self-closing tag that does not have a closing tag.
src attribute for specifying the image source:
• The src attribute is used to specify the URL or file path of the image to be displayed.
• The URL can be absolute (e.g., https://www.example.com/image.jpg) or relative to the
current page (e.g., images/image.jpg).
alt attribute for providing alternative text:
• The alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is displayed when the image
cannot be loaded or for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies.
• Alternative text should be descriptive and convey the purpose or content of the image.
• Example: <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
Image attributes
width and height attributes for resizing images:
• The width and height attributes specify the dimensions of the image in pixels or as a
percentage.
• Resizing images using these attributes can improve page load times and user experience.
• Example: <img src="image.jpg" width="500" height="300">
title attribute for providing additional information:
• The title attribute provides additional information or a tooltip about the image.
• This information is displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.
• Example: <img src="product.jpg" alt="Product Image" title="Our latest product">
loading attribute for controlling image loading behavior:
• The loading attribute, introduced in HTML5, allows you to control the loading behavior of
images.
• Possible values include auto (default), lazy (defers loading until the image is visible), and
eager (loads immediately).
• Example: <img src="large-image.jpg" loading="lazy">
Image optimization
Image compression and file size optimization:
• Optimizing image file sizes is crucial for improving website performance and reducing page
load times.
• Tools like ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or online compression services can help reduce image file
sizes without sacrificing quality.
Responsive images and resolution considerations:
• Responsive images adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring optimal display
on various devices.
• Techniques like using the srcset and sizes attributes, or employing responsive image
techniques with CSS and JavaScript, can provide better user experiences.
Figures and captions
<figure> and <figcaption> elements for grouping images with captions:
• The <figure> element represents a self-contained content unit, typically an image or
illustration.
• The <figcaption> element provides a caption or description for the <figure> content.
• Example:
<figure>
 <img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image">
 <figcaption>This is an example image with a caption.</figcaption>
</figure>
Student challenge:
• Create a gallery of images with appropriate sizing, captions, and alternative text.
• Experiment with different image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG) and their suitability for
various types of images.
• Optimize the file sizes of the images using compression tools or online services.
• Implement responsive image techniques to ensure optimal display on different screen sizes
and resolutions.
Practical example:
• Build a product showcase webpage with multiple images, optimized for different screen sizes
and resolutions.
• Use the <figure> and <figcaption> elements to display product images with descriptive
captions.
• Implement the loading attribute for lazy-loading large images or prioritizing critical images.
• Incorporate image optimization techniques to reduce file sizes without compromising quality.
• Style the images and captions using CSS for an appealing layout and presentation.
Summary:
• Images play a vital role in enhancing the visual appeal and usability of websites.
• The <img> element and its attributes (src, alt, width, height, etc.) are used to insert and
control images on web pages.
• Image optimization techniques, such as compression and responsive image techniques, are
crucial for improving website performance and user experience.
• The <figure> and <figcaption> elements provide a semantic way to group images with
captions.
• Proper use of alternative text and descriptive captions improves accessibility and
understanding of image content.
